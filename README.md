# stock_market

There is a .py version but it is best viewed with using the Ipython Notebook/Jupyter as it is incomplete.

My first major data project! I've been tying to learn so I started with the first set of data to come to mind: the stock market.
This project attempts to answer the following:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

Things that arent finished:

Currently 6 isn't solved yet and I also want it to save pictures of the graphs to a folder on a computer upon running.
